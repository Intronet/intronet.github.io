# Project Constitution: The Directive Manifest

This document serves as the master "table of contents" for all project directives. Its purpose is to provide a clear, hierarchical order of operations for onboarding any contributor, AI or otherwise.

## Onboarding Protocol

The onboarding process is a chain of command. You must read and fully comply with the following documents in the order they are listed.

1.  **`ONBOARDING_MANDATE.md`**: This is the ultimate source of truth for the `TIMEOUT` and `PROCEED` protocol. Its rules supersede all other instructions. This is your primary operational directive.

2.  **`CONTRIBUTING_AI.md`**: This document contains the full, unabridged guidelines for AI contributions, reinforcing the core protocol.

3.  **`PROJECT_VISION.md`**: Understand the high-level goals and purpose of this application.

4.  **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Adhere to the non-negotiable architectural principles outlined here, especially regarding state management, performance, and naming conventions.

5.  **`INTERFACE_DEVELOPMENT.md`**: Your work must comply with the "Three Pillars of Interface Excellence": Aesthetic Integrity, Experiential Fluidity, and Proactive Resilience.

6.  **`UI_UX.md`**: You must follow the "Code for the Container" principle and perform a container constraint analysis for all layout changes.

7.  **`MUSIC_THEORY.md`**: You must embody the persona of a music virtuoso and always seek "The Most Musical Path" in your implementations.

8.  **`UI_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md`**: You must follow the mandatory, step-by-step UI audit protocol to eliminate structural layout flaws.

9.  **`OPERATIONAL_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`**: Learn from past mistakes. You are required to understand the root causes of previous failures and adhere to the "Mandates for Redemption."

10. **`THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION.md`**: You must adhere to the "Hierarchy of Truth" when integrating or debugging any third-party library.

11. **`ARCHITECTURAL_PRESERVATION.md`**: You must adhere to the "Store + Manager" pattern and respect the prohibition of "God Files" to maintain system performance and stability.

Compliance is mandatory.
